<h1>the best movies according to Ericson</h1>
<h2>my top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Meet Joe Black</h3>
<p>romance and fantasy film with Brad Pitt,<br/>This is one of my favorites because I love old romances in movies.</p>

<h3> I Am Legend</h3>
<p>This is a fiction movie, I love it for the scenes and the engaging story and a lot of suspense.</p>

<h3>Sherlock Holmes</h3>
<p>This movie is sensational I love movies that have a character that solves all the problems,<br/> and with pressure situations where the actor still jokes like it's a small problem.
    <br/>who knows when i become a senior programmer it would solve the problems like Sherlock is just a joke lol
